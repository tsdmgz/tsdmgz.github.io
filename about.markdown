Ohai! You've probably followed the portfolio link from my resume. This place is
still being built and I'm figuring out what to place in here.

If you're wondering did a Chinese Studies major end up in the IT industry, it's
a mystery for myself too. That said, my Mandarin is enough to order food, keep
up with getting-to-know small talk for maybe a couple of lines or so, maybe read
a couple of characters. It's nowhere near usable in business contexts but I'm
working on that.

In either case, I'm in the job market right now and I want to hear about your
DevOps or Site Reliability Engineer roles in Manila, Philippines, or anywhere in
Taiwan.

This site was built with Jekyll on GitHub Pages. Deploys are made using GitHub's
default action for GitHub Pages, nothing too fancy.
