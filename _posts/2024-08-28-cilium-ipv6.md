title: Cilium and single stack IPv6
---

Quick notes before I forget, it might help someone too.

I've been wrestling with Cilium and single stack IPv6 Kubernetes clusters for
weeks. Pods were unable to talk to pods in other nodes but are able to within
the same node and I couldn't figure out why.

This cluster is running on a dual stack host but the cluster is configured for
single stack IPv6.

I believe I may have run into <https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/17240>.
The workaround was to enable native routing and configure IPv6 native routing
CIDR to the pod network[^native-routing]. All nodes were in the same L2 segment
so enabling `auto-direct-node-routes` is okay. I am forced to use IPv6
masquerading my ISP changes the delegated prefix on each connect-disconnect
cycle.

This was probably the cause of some applications occasionally stalling on some
requests too.

Don't forget to run `kubectl rollout restart` on `cilium-envoy` and
`cilium-operator` or else none of these will work.

Tayga runs on the network gateway providing NAT64 services. The missing piece
now is having incoming IPv4 traffic flow into the cluster, translated into IPv6.
