title: Shimano WH-RS370 rim diameter
---

For anyone looking, the nipple seat diameter of the WH-RS370 rim is 600mm.

* Outer rim diameter: 632mm
* Nipple seat to outer rim distance: 16mm
* Nipple seat diameter: 600mm

Add your spoke nipple height for effective rim diameter. This was also cross
measured by using Park Tool's method of taking two spokes of known length, fully
threading the nipple, then pulling it together end to end, measruing the gap in
between.

Using DT Swiss standard brass nipples, this gives me an effective rim diameter
for 604mm.

That is all.
