My career started with an unexpected phone call from a recruiter. They were
looking for someone with containerization and Ansible experience, and my profile
matched what they were looking for. It was the early days of Docker and LXC at
that time. To my surprise I was called in for a technical interview. It was a
whirlwind process, and was accepted in a week.

Fast forward to today, I've went as developer support, cloud and platform
support for a huge company. Linux is my specialty and I'm working on my skills
towards being a credible site reliability engineer.

I've also administered mail and comms suites for my coworkers, and implemented
policies that keep peoples' time and capabilities in mind.

My study queue has Kubernetes, more Ansible, and some bits of networking like
BGP. It's not cutting edge but I'd like to refine my foundations. [Maybe take a
look what I've been working on?](/)

(This one is a work in progress, admittedly it's a little hard to write about
yourself.)
